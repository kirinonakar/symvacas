# Catalog function reference

The function catalog inserts ready-to-fill templates into the current editor. Tap a template to insert it, then tap each empty slot (shown as `[]` or as a blank argument such as `round(x,)`) and type its value. In Python mode the same catalog inserts `calc.<function>(...)` and adds the shared `import symvacas_catalog as calc` line and the symbols `x, y, z, t, pi` once at the top of the file.

Use the search box above to filter by function name, template, example or description. The search matches every category at once. Clear the box to see the full reference again.

Tap an example to place its expression in the calculator input.

## Using the catalog
- Numeric trigonometry follows the selected DEG/RAD/GRAD angle unit. An explicit `pi` or `°` inside the expression overrides it.
- Symbolic calculus is always evaluated in radians.
- Matrix and vector commands accept literals such as `[[1,2],[3,4]]`.
- A saved custom function appears in the `Custom` category of the catalog.
- The Functions screen exports the custom library to a JSON file and imports it back; import validates each definition and reports added, replaced and skipped entries.
- Read the hint line under the catalog list for category-specific guidance.

## Step-by-step explanations

Android and Web use the same explanation engine. Explanations retain the computed answer and original domain restrictions; unsupported transformations show a solver summary.

Equation mode always includes explanations. In calculator mode, enable **Calc mode step by step** in Setup to include them on subsequent calculations; this option is off by default.

**Equations:** Linear/quadratic equations, factorable polynomials through degree 8 whose factors are linear or quadratic, cubic Cardano transformations, and power substitutions that reduce to a linear/quadratic equation (such as `x^6-5*x^3+6=0`). Simple trigonometric/exponential/logarithmic equations include inverse and periodic branches. Affine products with exponentials, such as `x*exp(x)=1`, explain the Lambert W inverse and the selected real or complex branches.

**Systems:** Linear systems with at most 6 equations and 6 unknowns, including parameter coefficients/right-hand sides when every pivot and consistency decision is provable. Two-variable polynomial systems with a linear equation support substitution when the remaining equation reduces to degree 2 or less, including matching each root with the other variable (for example, `x+y=3`, `x^2+y^2=5`). Symmetric quadratic systems determining `x^2+y^2` and `x*y` use the squared sum and difference and retain every sign combination. Parameter-dependent rank or consistency falls back to a summary.

Small two-variable polynomial systems with rational coefficients also show a lexicographic elimination basis and back-substitution of each returned solution, with original-equation residual checks. Internal polynomial division is omitted. For example, `solve([x^2+2*y^2=9,x*y=2],[x,y])` shows all four matching pairs. Large or complicated algebraic candidates retain a summary.

**Inequalities:** One-variable polynomial/rational inequalities with rational coefficients (degree at most 6) show factorization, zeros/poles, an exact test point in each interval, and endpoint inclusion. `solve(x^2<4,x)` explains why the solution is `-2<x<2`; denominator zeros are always excluded.

**ODEs:** First-order linear integrating factors with a verified elementary primitive, including nonpolynomial coefficients such as `1/t` and `sin(t)`. Homogeneous second-order equations with constant coefficients include characteristic roots and repeated-root solutions when the root case is decidable.

First-order separable equations show variable separation and formal integrals, with polynomial equilibrium solutions checked before division. Other explicit ODE solutions include a substitution check when their residual simplifies exactly to zero. Verification is distinguished from a full derivation and retains domain restrictions.

**Integration:** Verified SymPy manual-integration rules for the selected variable, including constant parameters. Parameter cases such as `a=0` in `exp(a*x)` and `a=-1` in `x^a` are explained separately. Definite bounds are shown only when the primitive's endpoint difference matches the computed answer. For a worked example, try `integrate(x*exp(x),x)`. Integrals such as `integrate(exp(-x^2)*cos(2*x),x,0,oo)` and `integrate(1/(x^4+1),x)` can produce an answer without a detailed derivation.

**Differentiation:** Sum/product/quotient, constant/variable powers, and common trigonometric/hyperbolic chain rules, through derivative order 10. Traversal is bounded to depth 12, 96 visits and 80 rule steps; omitted detail is reported.

**Limits:** Direct substitution excludes variable exponents and floor/ceiling, sign and piecewise jumps; these use other supported rules or a summary. Cancellation, square-root conjugates, checked `0/0` and infinity/infinity L'Hôpital transformations, highest-power comparison, one-sided cases, bounded local series, and sine/cosine squeeze cases.

These explanations have expression-size, traversal and output-size limits. Unsupported nonlinear systems and ODEs retain summaries; an indefinite integral without a detailed rule can show a derivative check when verified. A missing derivation does not establish that no closed form exists.

`solve(eq,x)` — Solve an equation or system for x. Tries the complex domain first, then automatically retries the real domain for unsupported expressions such as absolute values; the result note identifies real-domain solving. In systems, only variables needed by the real-valued terms are changed for that retry. Variable assumptions still apply. A ConditionSet means the symbolic solution is unresolved, not that a root exists. For a simple unresolved equation in one variable without free parameters, automatically searches −10 to 10 using graph root candidates, then refines and checks candidates against the original expression and domain. Displays at most 16 approximate real roots as partial results; roots can be missed even inside this interval, and complex roots are not searched. Integer-domain solving is excluded. For another interval use nsolve on a continuous interval with a sign change.
Example: solve(x^2-5x+6=0,x)
`solve(eq,x,real)` — Explicitly restrict the domain for one equation and one variable; complex and integer are also supported. Existing assumptions still apply. Omit the domain to enable automatic real-domain retry for absolute-value equations.

`solve(exp(x)=x,x)` — Returns the entire complex family −LambertW(−1,k), k ∈ ℤ. An explicitly real domain returns EmptySet. Affine exponential equations can use this full-branch strategy; auxiliary solve results for other Lambert W equations are labeled partial rather than complete.

`piecewise([expr,cond],...)` — Piecewise-defined function.

Graphs also accept Desmos-style `{condition:value,condition:value,default}`. The first matching branch wins; omit the default to leave unmatched values undefined. Example: `f(x)={x<0:x^2,x>=0:2*x}`. Append `{condition}` to restrict the whole preceding expression, with or without spaces or outer parentheses: `y=x^2 {0<=x<=2}` and `y=2*x {x>2}`. Chained inequalities are supported; excluded intervals are omitted and explicit polynomial branch boundaries are sampled separately to avoid connecting jumps.

### Independent and paired samples at a glance

| Data structure | Parametric comparison | Nonparametric comparison | Defaults / options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Two independent groups | Student / Welch t-test | Mann–Whitney U | Welch default; Student selectable |
| Two paired groups | Paired t-test | Wilcoxon signed-rank | Complete paired observations |
| 3+ independent groups | ANOVA / Welch ANOVA | Kruskal–Wallis | Welch ANOVA default |
| 3+ repeated conditions | Repeated-measures ANOVA | Friedman test | Complete paired observations |

Select by the data structure and target quantity. Rank-based location comparisons require appropriate distribution shapes or symmetry. Repeated conditions are measurements of the same subjects.

Choose by purpose, measurement scale and study design. Use Welch for unequal-variance means. One-way ANOVA defaults to Welch with Games–Howell; equal-variance ANOVA adds Tukey. Enter known population SDs for z tests.

Raw-data t tests, t intervals, ANOVA and Tukey include sample summaries, assumption checks, Q–Q plots and distributions. t tests add effect sizes and two-sided 95% mean intervals; ANOVA adds η² and automatic post-hoc comparisons; Tukey/Games–Howell add overall ANOVA. Paired t checks differences; ANCOVA and factorial linear models check residuals. Enter raw observations for normality checks.

### Normal-model methods (parametric)
- One-sample t / t intervals: normal population for exact small-sample inference. Paired t: normally distributed within-pair differences. Inspect Q–Q plots, skewness and outliers.
- Welch t / Welch ANOVA / Games–Howell: independent group means with unequal variances. Student t / classic ANOVA / Tukey: equal variances.
- ANCOVA / factorial linear models: normal independent errors, common residual variance and a full-rank design. ANCOVA uses linear covariate effects and common slopes. Review interactions before main effects; Type II respects marginality and Type III uses sum contrasts.
- Repeated-measures ANOVA: complete within-subject measurements; review sphericity and Greenhouse–Geisser corrected p values.
- Gaussian mixed models: normal conditional errors and random effects. Bayesian mean / two-sample models: normal likelihood with the selected priors.
- Bartlett: normally distributed groups. For uncertain normality, use median-centered Levene / Brown–Forsythe.

### Distribution assumptions by model
- Mean z tests / z intervals: enter known population SDs; the mean sampling distribution is normal or adequately approximated.
- Logistic / multinomial / ordinal: categorical outcomes. Poisson / negative binomial: count outcomes. Check the family, link, dispersion and model diagnostics.
- GEE: cluster mean/variance model and working correlation. Review cluster count, mean specification and robust standard errors.
- GLMM: selected response family and random effects. Bayesian proportion / rate: binomial / Poisson likelihoods.

### Rank, distribution and resampling methods (nonparametric)
- Mann–Whitney / Kruskal–Wallis: independent distributions. Comparable distribution shapes are needed for location interpretations.
- Wilcoxon signed-rank: paired or one-sample differences; symmetry is needed for a location interpretation.
- Friedman: three or more repeated conditions; complete matched rows, ranks within subjects and tie correction.
- Kolmogorov–Smirnov: continuous distributions. Specify one-sample reference parameters independently of the tested sample.
- Kaplan–Meier / log-rank: censored event times. Review independent subjects and censoring; Cox uses proportional hazards.
- IID bootstrap: independent, representative observations. Match paired, clustered or time-dependent sampling to the data structure.

### Categorical tests
- χ²: independent counts and adequate expected frequencies. Fisher exact: independent 2×2 counts. McNemar: paired binary outcomes.

### Choosing a method
Choose the outcome and question first: means, distributions, association, prediction or survival. Then select independent groups, paired observations or clusters. Assess assumptions using Q–Q plots, p values, sample sizes and study design. For skewed or dependent data, review transformations and a model that matches the distribution and sampling structure.

## Distribution functions matching Probability mode

Discrete CDFs include integer masses up to the real threshold; discrete PDFs return 0 for nonintegers.

Probability mode's **Normal parameter solver** finds μ or σ from P(X≤x)=q or P(X≥x)=q and the known parameter. Require 0<q<1 and positive σ. When q=0.5 and x=μ, σ is not uniquely determined.

## Regression inference and rank tests

`regression(data,polynomial,degree)` — Polynomial least squares, degrees 1–10.
Example: regression([[0,1],[1,3],[2,9],[3,25],[4,57]],polynomial,3)
`regression(data,multiple)` — Multiple linear regression with an intercept. Last column is response; preceding columns are predictors (up to eight). The x,y,z workspace uses x and y to predict z; the formula names them x1 and x2.
Example: regression([[0,0,1],[1,0,3],[0,1,4],[1,1,7],[2,1,8]],multiple)
`regression(data,logistic)` — Binomial logistic regression with an intercept and binary 0/1 response in the last column. Reports probability, coefficient/odds-ratio intervals, McFadden R², deviance, AIC and likelihood-ratio p. Complete separation automatically triggers Firth bias reduction; `regression(data,logistic,firth)` always applies Firth with profile penalized-likelihood intervals. Singular designs are rejected.
Example: regression([[-3,0],[-2,0],[-1,1],[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[3,1]],logistic)
`wilcoxon(differences)` — Compare paired differences using ranks when a symmetric location-shift model is appropriate. Signed-rank test against zero; zeros omitted. Also accepts paired x,y lists. Exact conditional sign permutation through 50 nonzero differences (including ties), otherwise tie-corrected normal approximation with continuity correction.
Example: wilcoxon([1,2,3,4,5])
`mannwhitney(x,y)` — Compare distributions of two independent groups using ranks; a median interpretation needs similar shapes. Independent rank test. Exact distribution for untied samples with min(nx,ny)≤8 and total n≤100; otherwise tie-corrected normal approximation with continuity correction. Tests distributions; a location interpretation requires comparable distribution shapes.
Example: mannwhitney([1,2,3],[4,5,6])
`kruskal(group1,group2,...)` — Compare distributions of independent groups using ranks; normality is not required. Tie-corrected Kruskal–Wallis H and chi-square p. The approximation is more reliable with at least five observations per group.
Example: kruskal([1,2,3,4,5],[4,5,6,7,8],[7,8,9,10,11])

Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney accept `left` or `right`; default is two-sided. Wilcoxon tests symmetric differences about zero; Mann–Whitney compares the first sample against the second.

In **n columns** mode, **Auto columns** sets the count from the widest CSV/TSV row, including headers and blank cells (1–100 columns). The option is saved. Turn it off to set the count manually.

Heat maps support raw values, row-wise and column-wise z scores, and pairwise Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall correlation. Correlation mode lets you select variables for the x and y axes; selecting a variable on one axis removes it from the other. Optional hierarchical clustering reorders rows and columns and draws dendrograms. Detected CSV headers label the columns. Missing cells are excluded from each pair; constant inputs and pairs with fewer than two complete observations show —.

Statistics visualization includes **Violin + points** and **Heat map**. Box and violin plots support **Horizontal** and **Vertical** orientation; the selected orientation is saved and applies to all grouped panels. Violin plots use Gaussian KDE with Scott's bandwidth, scaled to equal maximum width, with every finite observation overlaid as a Beeswarm at its original value. Only the category-axis position changes to avoid overlaps; dense groups use smaller markers to fit all observations within the group width. Singletons and constant groups show points only. Raw heat maps preserve input rows and columns; first/last grouping uses that column as row labels.

Statistics regression results show R², adjusted R², RMSE, residual SE, coefficient SE/p/95% t intervals and expandable residual diagnostics (plot, standardized residuals, leverage, Cook's D, Shapiro p, and Durbin–Watson in input order). Residual CSV includes every complete observation; the on-screen table previews 100 rows. For exponential/power fits inference uses log(y); amplitude SE uses the delta method and its CI is exponentiated. R²/RMSE and raw residuals remain in original y units. Custom nonlinear inference uses the local Jacobian and is approximate. Independent, constant-variance errors are assumed; bounded fits suppress ordinary inference, insufficient residual degrees of freedom leave inference unavailable, and constant responses leave R² undefined. Diagnostic p values for fitted residuals are exploratory.

Python: `import symvacas_catalog as calc; report = calc.regression_report([[1,2],[2,4],[3,5],[4,4],[5,5],[6,7]], "linear")` returns the same inference and full residual dictionary. Arguments match regression, including polynomial degree and custom model/options.

In Statistics mode, multiple regression lets you choose the dependent column among x/y/z; logistic regression supports x/y and x/y/z. The other columns are predictors; the logistic response must contain both 0 and 1. The default is the last column. The input table stays in its original order, and fitted formulas and scatter axes use the chosen column names. Odds ratio and OR 95% CI labels remain English in either language.

Logistic regression also reports C-statistic (ROC AUC) and an ROC graph (FPR versus sensitivity/TPR). Tied scores receive half credit; the diagonal is the chance reference (AUC=0.5). ROC/AUC use the fitted observations with positive class 1 and are apparent training performance.

Bayesian regression: select **Bayesian linear regression** (`bayeslinear`) or **Bayesian logistic regression** (`bayeslogistic`). Both support any dependent column, at least 2 complete rows, up to 5000 observations and 20 predictors, including collinear/constant predictors with proper priors. The logistic response must contain both 0 and 1. Priors are zero-mean on centered, RMS-standardized predictors and include the intercept; reported coefficients are in original units. Prior SD defaults to 2.5 (range 0.000001–1000000); equal-tailed credible level defaults to 0.95 (strictly between 0 and 1).

`regression(data,bayeslinear,[priorSD,level,shape,scale])` uses beta|sigma² ~ Normal(0, priorSD² sigma² I), sigma² ~ inverse-gamma(shape,scale); defaults [2.5,0.95,2,1]. Coefficient marginal posteriors and new-observation predictive intervals are exact Student-t distributions. Posterior SD differs from the Student-t scale. `regression(data,bayeslogistic,[priorSD,level])` uses beta ~ Normal(0,priorSD² I) with a Gaussian Laplace approximation at the MAP. Results show posterior estimates/SD, credible intervals, P(beta>0), logistic odds ratios and ROC/AUC. Predictions and training metrics evaluate the coefficient point estimate, rather than averaging predictions over the posterior. These intervals are Bayesian credible intervals, not frequentist confidence intervals; p values are not reported.

Regularized regression: choose None, Ridge, LASSO, or Elastic Net under linear/multiple or logistic regression. Predictors are standardized to zero mean and unit population SD; the intercept is unpenalized and displayed coefficients use original units. Alpha must be positive and L1 ratio is 0–1. The linear objective is SSE/(2n) + alpha[(1−ratio)||beta||²/2 + ratio||beta||₁]; logistic uses mean log loss instead of SSE/(2n). Ridge uses ratio 0 and LASSO uses ratio 1. Ridge alpha therefore differs in scale from libraries minimizing SSE + alpha||beta||².
Use `regression(data,ridge,alpha)`, `regression(data,lasso,alpha)`, or `regression(data,elasticnet,[alpha,l1_ratio])`. Logistic modes are `logisticridge`, `logisticlasso`, and `logisticelasticnet`; the response must contain both 0 and 1. Defaults: alpha 0.1, L1 ratio 0.5. The last column is response; Statistics allows selecting another column. Up to 5000 rows and 100 predictors are supported, with incomplete rows excluded by the workspace. Results include training fit, coefficients, residuals, and logistic AUC/ROC/log loss/accuracy. Ordinary OLS/Wald inference is unavailable. These models use 64-bit floating point arithmetic.
Example: regression([[0,1],[1,3],[2,5],[3,7]],lasso,0.1)
Example: regression([[-2,0],[-1,0],[1,1],[2,1]],logisticelasticnet,[0.1,0.5])
`regression(data,randomforest,[trees,max_depth,seed])` — Random Forest regression. Defaults [100,10,0]; 1–200 trees, depth 1–20, seed 0–2147483647. Averages bootstrap CART squared-error trees, trying sqrt(predictor count) features per node and additional features if sampled features cannot split. Fixed seeds reproduce results. Reports training R²/RMSE, OOB R²/RMSE and coverage, impurity feature importance, and OOB permutation importance (decrease in R²). Permutation importance averages three shuffles on at most 200 OOB observations and may be negative; a constant OOB response leaves it undefined. Forests cannot be transferred as an algebraic graph expression; x,y data displays a prediction curve.
Example: regression([[0,0],[1,1],[2,4],[3,9],[4,16]],randomforest,[100,10,0])
Python: `calc.regression_report(data,"elasticnet",[0.1,0.5])` or `calc.regression_report(data,"randomforest",[100,10,0])` returns the report dictionary.

Random Forest classification: the default task is Auto. A 0/1 response selects binary classification; other responses select regression. Classification requires both classes, with positive class 1. You can also select Regression or Binary classification explicitly, or use `regression(data,randomforestclassifier,[trees,depth,seed])` / `randomforestregressor`. Binary squared-error splits are equivalent to Gini splits; probabilities average the class-1 fraction in each tree leaf. ROC/AUC uses these probabilities, and C-statistic equals AUC. Probability ≥0.5 predicts class 1. Confusion matrix rows are observed 0/1 and columns predicted 0/1: [[TN,FP],[FN,TP]]. Sensitivity=TP/(TP+FN), specificity=TN/(TN+FP), accuracy=(TP+TN)/n. Training and OOB metrics, ROC curves, and confusion matrices are separate. Rows without OOB predictions are excluded from OOB evaluation, and absent classes leave the corresponding ratios/AUC unavailable. Classification permutation importance measures decrease in OOB AUC.
Example: regression([[-3,0],[-2,0],[-1,0],[1,1],[2,1],[3,1]],randomforestclassifier,[100,10,0])

Regularized logistic regression (Ridge/LASSO/Elastic Net) also reports predictor Odds ratio=exp(beta), using original-unit coefficients for a one-unit predictor increase with other predictors held fixed. A coefficient shrunk to zero by LASSO has OR=1. The intercept is not shown as a predictor OR. Ordinary Wald OR confidence intervals are unavailable for penalized estimates.

Unregularized logistic regression automatically applies Firth bias reduction (log L + 0.5 log|X′WX|) when a strictly separating coefficient vector certifies complete separation; ordinary datasets retain MLE. Passing `firth` as the third argument applies the same estimator to ordinary datasets. Results explicitly identify Firth and include finite coefficients, OR, probabilities and ROC/AUC. Coefficient/OR 95% intervals come from the profile penalized likelihood; p values remain Wald. Ordinary MLE AIC and likelihood-ratio tests are omitted for Firth fits. Constant responses and singular designs remain invalid; Ridge/LASSO/Elastic Net keep their selected penalty, and `cv` selects the penalty alpha by five-fold cross-validation.
Logistic residual diagnostics and full CSV include leverage and Cook's distance. The one-step GLM approximation uses hᵢ=wᵢxᵢ′(X′WX)⁻¹xᵢ and Cook Dᵢ=Pearsonᵢ²hᵢ/[p(1−hᵢ)²]. Firth uses Fisher information at the bias-reduced fit. Penalized models use a local active-predictor design including the intercept and the L2 Hessian, holding predictor selection fixed. Singular active designs or h=1 leave unavailable diagnostics empty.

NUTS: choose NUTS under Inference method. Prior options: linear `[2.5,0.95,2,1,[nuts,500,500,8,0,2]]`, logistic `[2.5,0.95,[nuts,500,500,8,0,2]]`. Sampler order: samples,warmup,maxDepth,seed,chains. Check R-hat, ESS, MCSE, divergences and depth-limit hits. A fixed seed reproduces draws.

## Advanced statistics

Choose current data, example parameters or an editable analysis expression. Paired comparisons use complete pairs and support subject-ID matching. Enter complete subject rows for repeated measurements; impute treats missing cells as NA.

### Data preparation

`impute` — Prepare incomplete data by single imputation; subsequent inference omits imputation uncertainty. NA for missing cells; mean / median / mode / regression / knn with neighbours (default 5). Single imputation.
Example: impute([[1,NA],[2,4],[NA,6],[4,8]],mean)

### Categorical data

Optional both / left / right. Null-based standard error, no continuity correction; independent observations and adequate expected counts are required.
Example: propztest(0.5,[[60,100]])

`propztest2` — Compare two independent success proportions using a pooled z test. propztest2(A,B) or propztest2(successesA,trialsA,successesB,trialsB). H0: pA=pB; pooled standard error, no continuity correction. Optional both / left / right for A−B. Independent binary samples; paired outcomes require McNemar.
Example: propztest2(60,100,45,100)

Example: cramerv([[20,5],[7,18]])

`phi` — Phi coefficient. Signed phi for a 2×2 integer count table; swapping one category order reverses its sign. No Yates correction.
Example: phi([[20,5],[7,18]])

`cohenkappa` — Cohen’s κ agreement. Two-rater square count table with common category order. Unweighted, linear or quadratic kappa; multinomial delta-method SE and asymptotic Wald CI. Weighted categories must be ordered. Observed/expected agreement use the selected weights; exact agreement is also reported.

`repeatedanova` — Compare repeated conditions within the same subjects in a balanced design. Rows=subjects, columns=conditions. Second-factor levels: 1 = one-way, 2+ = two-way (first factor slowest); GG corrections.
Example: repeatedanova([[2,4,5],[3,4,7],[4,7,8],[2,3,6],[5,6,7]],1)

`friedman` — Compare three or more matched conditions by within-subject ranks; chi-square approximation with tie correction. Rows are independent subjects; columns are at least three repeated conditions. Complete matched rows, midranks and tie correction. Chi-square approximation; small samples or few conditions can give inaccurate p values. Reports Kendall W.
Example: friedman([[2,4,5],[3,4,7],[4,7,8],[2,3,6],[5,6,7]])

### Effect sizes & multiple testing

General OLS with numeric and categorical predictors. Categorical positions are one-based; interaction order, Type II/III, sum/treatment coding. Uses joint partial F tests for each term. Three-way and higher interactions require enough replicated observations and identifiable columns.
Example: linearmodel([[1,1,2],[1,1,4],[1,2,5],[1,2,6],[2,1,4],[2,1,5],[2,2,8],[2,2,10]],[1,2],2,3,sum)

Default links: identity, logit, log, log, log, log. Model-based Wald z 95% intervals; Pearson dispersion for Gaussian/Gamma/inverse Gaussian. Use estimate as the fourth argument to estimate NB2 alpha jointly with coefficients; its uncertainty enters the observed-information covariance. Numeric alpha retains the fixed-alpha model.
Example: glm([[0,2],[1,4],[2,4],[3,7],[4,8],[5,9]],gaussian,auto,1)

`poissonreg` — Model event counts, optionally accounting for exposure. Rows: predictors, integer count response. Log link. Optional second argument row-aligned offset/exposure list; third argument offset (default) or exposure (positive, log transformed).

Gaussian random intercept with up to three random slopes (0 none, a predictor position, or [1,2]); third argument reml (default) or ml; up to 5000 rows. Includes subject BLUPs, slope correlations and singular-fit diagnostics; random-slope ICC is at x=0; asymptotic Wald z inference. Optional fourth argument: profile (ML fixed-effect profile CI) or [bootstrap,200,0] (parametric fixed-effect percentile CI); alternative CI omit Wald p-values. Reports logLik/AIC/BIC; compare REML criteria only with identical fixed effects and data. Nonconverged fits withhold Wald inference.
Example: mixedmodel([[1,0,2],[1,1,4],[1,2,4],[2,0,3],[2,1,4],[2,2,6],[3,0,1],[3,1,3],[3,2,4],[4,0,4],[4,1,5],[4,2,8]],0,reml)

`glmm` — Model clustered binary or count outcomes with subject-specific random effects. Rows: subject ID, predictors, response. Random intercept, optionally one correlated random slope (seventh argument: selected predictor position, 0 = none). Slopes use two-dimensional Laplace (third argument 1), use [],offset,likelihood before the slope position. Covariance and conditional modes are reported in original units. Random intercept: binomial (0/1, logit), poisson or nbinom (NB2, log). ML adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature: 15 points default, 1 = Laplace, otherwise 7-31. Optional fourth argument offset vector, fifth offset / exposure. Limit 1500 rows, 8 fixed coefficients. Subject-specific effects; joint marginal observed information by central differences; asymptotic Wald inference. Few-subject Wald inference may be unreliable. Integration checks compare likelihood at another point count, including Laplace/31 points; optional sixth argument refit compares coefficients and suppresses CI/p if shifts exceed 0.1 SE. To omit offsets use [],offset before refit.
Example: glmm([[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,2,1],[2,0,0],[2,1,1],[2,2,1],[3,0,0],[3,1,0],[3,2,0],[4,0,1],[4,1,1],[4,2,1],[5,0,1],[5,1,0],[5,2,1],[6,0,0],[6,1,1],[6,2,0]],binomial,15)

`gee` — Estimate population-average effects for repeated or clustered outcomes. Rows: cluster ID, predictors, response. gaussian / binomial / poisson; working correlation independence / exchangeable / ar1; fourth argument [i,j] interaction pairs; sandwich SE. Pearson dispersion-adjusted correlation; AR(1) uses row order and equal spacing. Few-cluster Wald inference may be unreliable. Optional fifth argument small adds Mancl-DeRouen covariance and t inference with clusters minus coefficient count df; use [] as the fourth argument when there are no interactions. Review the cluster count when interpreting intervals.
Example: gee([[1,0,2],[1,1,4],[1,2,4],[2,0,3],[2,1,4],[2,2,6],[3,0,1],[3,1,3],[3,2,4],[4,0,4],[4,1,5],[4,2,8]],gaussian,independence)

### Bayesian inference

`bayesmean` — Estimate a normal mean with a chosen prior and predictive interval. Normal sample, unknown variance; prior mu0,kappa0,alpha0,beta0; credible level; threshold. Variance ~ InvGamma(alpha0,beta0), mean | variance ~ Normal(mu0,variance/kappa0). Defaults 0,1,2,1 are proper, scale-dependent priors. Returns Student-t mean interval and next-observation predictive interval.
Example: bayesmean([1,2,3,4,5],0,1,2,1,0.95,0)

`bayescompare` — Compare two independent normal means with posterior differences and Bayes factors. Two independent normal samples (at least 2 each); variance equal / unequal; mu0,kappa0,alpha0,beta0; credible level; IID posterior draws (2000-100000), seed. H1: independent Normal(mu0,variance/kappa0) means with shared (equal) or independent (unequal) InvGamma(alpha0,beta0) variances. H0: B-A=0 with nuisance prior conditioned from H1. BF10/BF01 use the Savage-Dickey density ratio. Reports B-A mean, equal-tailed credible interval, P(muB>muA), and posterior effect (B-A)/sqrt((varianceA+varianceB)/2). Equal-mode difference summaries and BF are analytic; unequal BF uses numerical t convolution, unequal intervals/probability and effect intervals use simulation. MCSE, draws and seed are reported. Defaults are proper but unit-dependent; choose priors before inspecting outcomes.
Example: bayescompare([10,11,9,10,12],[13,14,12,15,13],equal,0,0.01,2,1,0.95,20000,0)

`bayesproportion` — Estimate a binary success proportion using a Beta prior. Binary 0/1 list or [[successes,trials],...]; Beta prior alpha, beta (default 1,1); credible level; threshold p0 in (0,1). Returns equal-tailed interval, P(p>p0), next-success probability and BF10 (Beta alternative / point null p=p0).

`bayesrate` — Estimate a Poisson event rate using counts and exposure. Count list (one exposure unit each) or [[count,exposure],...]; Gamma prior shape, rate (inverse scale, default 1,1); credible level; nonnegative threshold.

`bayesbootstrap` — Quantify posterior uncertainty in statistics using random weights on observations. Dirichlet(1,…,1) weights on IID observed values; mean / median / variance / stdev, credible level, draws, seed. Median estimate uses the ordinary sample median (average the two middle values for even n); posterior draws use the Lower weighted quantile (smallest value with weighted CDF >= 0.5); variance/SD use population weights. Equal-tailed simulated posterior interval and histogram. Two samples: bayesbootstrap(A,B,mean,0.95,10000,0,independent); paired uses shared row weights. Comparison is statistic(B) - statistic(A).
Example: bayesbootstrap([1,2,3,4,5,8],mean,0.95,10000,0)

### Measurement & structural models

`efa` — Exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Select numeric item columns. Extraction: pa (principal axis, default), ml (normal maximum likelihood common factors), or pca (principal components). Enter a factor count or parallel for automatic selection. Rotations: oblimin (default, delta 0), varimax, none or promax (power 4). Arguments: data,count,rotation,extraction,parallel simulations,seed,percentile. Parallel simulations: 0 = off; automatic selection defaults to 100, percentile 0.95. Reports KMO, Bartlett, communalities, pattern and structure loadings, factor correlations and regression scores. PA/ML factor counts use SMC-reduced common roots for parallel analysis; PCA uses correlation eigenvalues. For correlated factors, interpret communalities with the factor correlations. Loading plots show selected rotated components/factors with selectable axes and item labels. PA/PCA explained variance (%) and cumulative explained variance (%) use extraction eigenvalues / standardized item count; ML uses unrotated common squared-loading sums / item count; Varimax also reports rotated squared-loading shares. Oblique pattern squared-loading sums are not additive variance shares. Run CFA transfers the analyzed data and column order, assigning each indicator to its largest absolute rotated loading. Review/edit memberships; model df and the fitted information matrix determine identification. Cross-loading detection uses secondary absolute rotated pattern loadings ≥ 0.30 by default. Change the cutoff, disable automatic inclusion or uncheck individual candidates before CFA. This is a screening rule, not a significance test. ML assumes multivariate normal complete data and fits positive uniquenesses by normal likelihood. ML variance percentages use unrotated common squared-loading sums / item count; ML χ² uses the Bartlett correction and reports model df/p. Boundary uniqueness or unidentified factor counts require revising the model.

`cfa` — Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Choose ML for continuous indicators or WLSMV for numeric ordinal category codes (ordered numerically). No fixed minimum indicator count per factor; identification is checked using model df and the information matrix. The first pure primary indicator (otherwise the first primary indicator) fixes its primary loading at 1. Cross-loadings use [indicator,factor] pairs and may also be added on marker indicators. ML supports complete rows or FIML under MCAR/MAR. WLSMV requires complete rows and uses probit thresholds/polychoric correlations, DWLS, full influence-covariance sandwich SEs and scaled-shifted mean/variance-adjusted T3. Measurement invariance: configural (group free), metric (equal loadings), scalar (also equal intercepts for ML or response thresholds for WLSMV), strict (also equal residual variances). Scalar/strict estimate other-group latent means, fixing reference means to zero. Multi-group scalar/strict WLSMV requires the same observed categories in each group, at least three per indicator; reference residual variances are 1, scalar frees them in other groups and strict fixes all to 1. Reports chi-square, df, p, CFI, TLI, RMSEA and complete-data SRMR. WLSMV fit indices use adjusted tests; adjusted chi-squares cannot be subtracted for difference testing. Arguments: data,factors,cross-loadings,complete/fiml,group IDs,configural/metric/scalar/strict,ml/wlsmv. Reports fully standardized loadings and paths with delta-method 95% Wald confidence intervals, including standardized marker uncertainty. The diagram uses ellipses for latent factors, rectangles for indicators, standardized coefficients with intervals, and latent R² = 1 − disturbance variance / total latent variance for endogenous factors (not applicable to exogenous factors). Multi-group diagrams are selectable by group; WLSMV loadings describe underlying probit responses. Use Fit diagram to screen to scale the whole diagram to the available width and height; Original size restores scrolling. Run SEM keeps the fitted measurement model, cross-loadings, data, group IDs and estimation options. Enter acyclic latent paths before execution; structural direction is not inferred from CFA. Indicator R² reports variance explained by the latent factors in each observed indicator, including factor covariance for cross-loadings; WLSMV uses the underlying probit response. Indicator R² is displayed in both tables and diagrams. Optional arguments after estimator: residual covariance pairs [[2,3],[5,6]], modification indices 0 (Off, default) / 1 (On), bootstrap count 0 (default), seed 0. Pairs refer to selected indicator positions; strict invariance shares their raw covariances. MI/EPC list single additional cross-loadings, residual covariances and acyclic paths. ML uses expected-information efficient scores; WLSMV uses robust DWLS scores, not a difference of adjusted T3 tests. Review theory before adding parameters. Residual covariances and options transfer from CFA to SEM.

`sem` — Structural equation model (SEM). Choose ML for continuous indicators or WLSMV for numeric ordinal category codes (ordered numerically). No fixed minimum indicator count per factor; identification is checked using model df and the information matrix. The first pure primary indicator (otherwise the first primary indicator) fixes its primary loading at 1. Cross-loadings use [indicator,factor] pairs and may also be added on marker indicators. ML supports complete rows or FIML under MCAR/MAR. WLSMV requires complete rows and uses probit thresholds/polychoric correlations, DWLS, full influence-covariance sandwich SEs and scaled-shifted mean/variance-adjusted T3. Measurement invariance: configural (group free), metric (equal loadings), scalar (also equal intercepts for ML or response thresholds for WLSMV), strict (also equal residual variances). Scalar/strict estimate other-group latent means, fixing reference means to zero. Multi-group scalar/strict WLSMV requires the same observed categories in each group, at least three per indicator; reference residual variances are 1, scalar frees them in other groups and strict fixes all to 1. Reports chi-square, df, p, CFI, TLI, RMSEA and complete-data SRMR. WLSMV fit indices use adjusted tests; adjusted chi-squares cannot be subtracted for difference testing. Add acyclic latent paths [source,target]; exogenous factors may covary, endogenous disturbances and indicator errors are independent. Arguments: data,factors,paths,cross-loadings,complete/fiml,group IDs,configural/metric/scalar/strict,ml/wlsmv. Reports fully standardized loadings and paths with delta-method 95% Wald confidence intervals, including standardized marker uncertainty. The diagram uses ellipses for latent factors, rectangles for indicators, standardized coefficients with intervals, and latent R² = 1 − disturbance variance / total latent variance for endogenous factors (not applicable to exogenous factors). Multi-group diagrams are selectable by group; WLSMV loadings describe underlying probit responses. Use Fit diagram to screen to scale the whole diagram to the available width and height; Original size restores scrolling. Indicator R² reports variance explained by the latent factors in each observed indicator, including factor covariance for cross-loadings; WLSMV uses the underlying probit response. Indicator R² is displayed in both tables and diagrams. Optional arguments after estimator: residual covariance pairs [[2,3],[5,6]], modification indices 0 (Off, default) / 1 (On), bootstrap count 0 (default), seed 0. Pairs refer to selected indicator positions; strict invariance shares their raw covariances. MI/EPC list single additional cross-loadings, residual covariances and acyclic paths. ML uses expected-information efficient scores; WLSMV uses robust DWLS scores, not a difference of adjusted T3 tests. Review theory before adding parameters. Residual covariances and options transfer from CFA to SEM. Direct, total indirect and total latent effects sum products over all specified directed paths, with raw/standardized delta-method 95% Wald intervals. Bootstrap count: 0 = off, otherwise at least 20 (1000 or more recommended for final inference). Stratified case resampling refits the full model each draw; seeded 95% percentile CIs are shown separately. Execution time/work budgets scale with the requested refits; manual cancellation remains available. Failed refits are counted; CI requires at least 20 and 80% successful draws. Coefficient products alone do not establish causal mediation.

### Multivariate analysis

`pca` — Summarize correlated numeric features using fewer components. Rows=observations, columns=features; components, standardize 1/0.
Example: pca([[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[4,3],[5,7]],2,1)

`discriminantanalysis` — Discriminant analysis (LDA/QDA). Rows: features, class. LDA pooled / QDA separate unbiased covariances; empirical/equal priors. Optional fourth argument: new feature rows. Training confusion and accuracy use the fitted sample.
Example: discriminantanalysis([[1,2,1],[2,1,1],[1,1,1],[2,3,1],[4,5,2],[5,4,2],[4,4,2],[5,6,2]],lda,empirical)

`kmeans` — Group observations by numeric-feature similarity; check feature scales first. Numeric feature rows; k, seed. Euclidean distance, 10 restarts, raw feature scale.
Example: kmeans([[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[8,8],[8,9],[9,8]],2,0)

`hcluster` — Hierarchical clustering. Independent agglomerative analysis; clusters, single/complete/average/Ward Euclidean linkage, standardize 1/0. Returns all merges, heights, sizes and cut assignments. Leaves 1…n, merge nodes n+1…2n−1.
Example: hcluster([[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[8,8],[8,9],[9,8]],2,ward,1)

### Survival analysis

`survivalanalysis` — Analyze censored time-to-event data as a Kaplan–Meier, log-rank and optional Cox set. Rows: time, event (0/1), group ID, optional Cox predictors; Cox 0=off, 1=on; then ties and the PH check.
Example: survivalanalysis([[1,1,1],[2,1,2],[3,0,1],[4,1,2],[5,1,1],[6,0,2],[7,1,2],[8,1,1]],0,efron,-1,1)

`kaplanmeier` — Estimate survival over time while accounting for censoring. Rows: time, event (1=event, 0=censored); confidence level.
Example: kaplanmeier([[1,1],[2,0],[3,1],[4,1],[5,0],[6,1]],0.95)

`logrank` — Compare survival between two groups without adjusting for predictors. Two time/event tables. Current data: time, event, group (exactly two groups).
Example: logrank([[1,1],[3,1],[4,0],[6,1]],[[2,0],[4,1],[5,1],[7,0]])

`cox` — Relate predictors to event hazard; review proportional hazards. Rows: time, event 0/1, predictors. Ties efron (default) or breslow; entry column for left truncation (-1 none); PH check 0/1.
Example: cox([[1,1,0],[2,1,1],[3,0,0],[4,1,1],[5,1,0],[6,0,1],[7,1,1],[8,1,0]],efron,-1,1)

### Power & sample size

`testpower` — Evaluate power for a planned t-test design and effect size. Cohen d, n per group/pairs, alpha, independent / paired / onesample, alternative two (default) / greater / less. Exact noncentral-t power.
Example: testpower(0.5,64,0.05,independent)

`samplesize` — Plan the sample size needed for a target t-test power. Cohen d, target power, alpha, design, alternative. Exact noncentral-t power.
Example: samplesize(0.5,0.8,0.05,independent)
